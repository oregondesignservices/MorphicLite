Morphic Lite Tasks
=====

All tasks are tracked in the [MorphicLite](https://github.com/orgs/oregondesignservices/projects/1) GitHub project.

Goals
----

* Clearly communicate assignments and priorities
* Track progress
* Ensure everything gets done

The tasks **are reality**.

* If you're working on something that's not on the list, add it
* If you need to split a task into 2 or 12, do it
* If you start work on task, move it to the `In Progress` column
* If a task's title or description is unclear, fix it

It is **everyone's** responsibility to keep the task list up to date and matching reality. 

Columns
----

- **Backlog**: For tasks that have been identified, but aren't yet on anyone's plate
- **Up Next**: For tasks that have been assigned, but aren't yet started
- **In Progress**: For tasks that are currently being worked
- **Complete**: For tasks that are done and merged

Sorting
----

Items in the **Backlog** column are roughly sorted with higher priority items at the top.

Items in the **Up Next** and **In Progress** columns are sorted exactly by priority with the highest priority items at the top.  When you're working your list of assigned items, you should work from top to bottom.

Creating Issues
-----

Issues are created in the specific repository they're related to.  But when you create the issue, be sure to add a link to the
`MorphicLite` project over on the right side below assignments.

For rough ideas, you can simply create a note directly on the board in the project.  Notes, however, cannot be assigned to an
individual, associated with a specific repo, or include a disucssion, so we expect to make limited use of notes.

Subtasks & Issue Splitting
-----

As a general guideline, each issue should correspsond 1-to-1 with a deliverible like a PR.
If you want to keep track of subtasks, you can make a checkbox list in the issue's description using `- [ ] ` prefixed lines.

Sometimes, however, what starts as a single issue ends up resulting in several deliverables.
In these cases, split the original issue into as many as you need.

Pull Request Linking
------

When you create a pull request, include a note about how it `closes #XY` or `fixes #XY` or `resolves #XY` to link issue #XY to the pull request.
Alternatively, you can manually make the link from either the pull request or issue.

Linked pull requests show up attached to the issue in the project task board which helps everyone else see what is going on.
